# Why use AnYme?

AnYme is not a competing app. I do not maintain it for the sake of being better than other apps. That said, there are some reasons to pick AnYme over other apps. Here's just a small list:

* No Ads
* MAL integration. In fact, AnYme was the first app with MAL integration after their site was relaunched. (An Alpha download was available in less than 3 hours after the site came online)
* Alpha updates are released multiple times per week
* It has a subreddit with more than 15.5K subscribers (https://anyme.app/reddit)
* It requires no app permissions to function, so you can use the app without fearing your data getting stolen.
* It has a public Trello board so you can follow the development progress (https://anyme.app/todo)
* ðŸŽ‰ And best of all, this is not made using Xamarin/Visual Studio! ðŸŽ‰
